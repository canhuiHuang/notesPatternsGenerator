- If 1 - 8, stop
- [NEW: Include patterns whose sum is equal to 0], rule: stops when 1 or beyond (whether 17 has been reached or not) or 17 and beyond is reached.
- When 17 is reached or passed, arguments orders reset and they are multiplied by -1. Then stop the pattern when 1 or beyond 1 is reached.
- Now, filters are stored in the browser. So filters are kept even after the application restarts.
